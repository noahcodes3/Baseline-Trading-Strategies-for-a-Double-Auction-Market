# Step 1: Creates traders

# An informed trader using signal-following

# A zero-intelligence trader
t2 = Trader(uaid=2, cash=5000.0, shares=50.0, trader_type="zi")

# A noise trader (separate class, no signal needed)
t3 = NoiseTrader(uaid=3, cash=5000.0, shares=50.0)

# Step 2:

# Current state of the world
# S_t from Matthew's GBM framework
# Placeholders for current cash and shares for each trader (could be different in a real test)

# Generated signals from Marian's signal generator.
# For now, these are just mocked them:
signal_t1 = 1.08  # t1 thinks price goes up 8%
signal_t2 = 0.97  # t2 gets a signal too, but ZI ignores it

# Step 4: 

# Each trader generates an order based on their strategy and the current state.
# Note: the actual order dict structure and validation would depend on the implementation of place_order and
# the expected format for Ahmed's String mechanism.
