Baseline Trading Strategies for Double Auction 
This module defines several trading strategies and a Trader class that can use them.

The strategies include:
- zero_intelligence: random orders ignoring the signal
- signal_following: uses the signal to set price and quantity
- mixed: randomly chooses between strategies based on provided probabilities

Example usage:
trader = Trader(uaid=1, cash=5000.0, shares=50.0, info_param=0.1, trader_type="signal_following")
order = trader.place_order(signal=1.08, value=100.0)
